This R script automates archiving of files from a source directory to one or more destinations, preserving relative paths and creating missing directories as needed. .tar files can be optionally renamed with a date prefix derived from the source folder name, and existing files can be overwritten if desired. A progress bar tracks the operation, ensuring organized, traceable, and reproducible file management across multiple storage locations.
